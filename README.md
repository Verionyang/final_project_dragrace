Excerpts about Drag Race from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_Race_(franchise)):

>RuPaul's Drag Race, and Drag Race variants, is a television drag queen competition franchise created by American drag entertainer RuPaul, and the production company World of Wonder. It originated in the United States with RuPaul's Drag Race in 2009, where it was devised as a replacement for Rick & Steve: The Happiest Gay Couple in All the World (2007–2009). The show's aim is to find the next "Drag Superstar" who possesses the traits of "charisma", "uniqueness", "nerve" and "talent". RuPaul stated that the show looks for an entertainer who can stand out from the rest. RuPaul’s Drag Race is often credited for bringing drag into the "mainstream" media.

## Find your drag mother
This application is to help you find your drag mother among all contestants listed in the database. After answering a few questions, you will be either adopted by a 'Queen of the people' (AKA a drag queen who has won the Miss Congeniality) or by a 'Crowning Queen' (AKA all contestants who have had a top-3 finish in any season available in the database).

### Now start your engine and may the best woman win!

## Drag name creator
Shakespeare once said: 
> A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.

But when it comes to drag business, a name is truly important. 
With drag, your name should be: 
1. Memorable
2. About you

This application helps you find your drag name based on the drag mother who just adopted you. But alternatively, you will also get a drag name based on your full name. 

## Lip sync Spotify look-up
This application collects all the lip sync songs competed in Rupaul's Drag Race herstory. It will ask your music preference and recommend you a lip sync song to your liking. 
The original song list comes from an existing playlist on Spotify: [RuPaul Lip Syncs Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/49xR85Shg0IuVS9xkcfNm6)

### Now it's time for you to lip sync FOR YOUR LIFE! Good luck and don't fk it up!
