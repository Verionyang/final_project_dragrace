Excerpts about Drag Race from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_Race_(franchise)):

>RuPaul's Drag Race, and Drag Race variants, is a television drag queen competition franchise created by American drag entertainer RuPaul, and the production company World of Wonder. It originated in the United States with RuPaul's Drag Race in 2009, where it was devised as a replacement for Rick & Steve: The Happiest Gay Couple in All the World (2007–2009). The show's aim is to find the next "Drag Superstar" who possesses the traits of "charisma", "uniqueness", "nerve" and "talent". RuPaul stated that the show looks for an entertainer who can stand out from the rest. RuPaul’s Drag Race is often credited for bringing drag into the "mainstream" media.
